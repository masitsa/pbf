Privatebushflights allows all certified air charter operator’s one centralized location to offer heavily discounted charter flights to the general public. </p>
                    <p>Our service allows travelers to purchase flights on charter aircraft which would be otherwise travelling empty. This includes luxury planes, light aircraft, airliners and helicopters. </p>

                    <p>Charter aircraft are like "taxi cabs of the sky". Our flights can be to/from anywhere in Africa or beyond, but are random in nature and many occur at short notice. We are not a scheduled airline service but invite you to make the most of the flight opportunities that are listed on our site. </p>

                    <h4>What is an 'Empty Leg', and how does the process work?</h4>
                    
                    <p>An aircraft which is positioning to an airport /Airstrip / destination to perform a charter, or is returning to base having completed a charter will usually operate these sectors empty. These are known as empty legs, and these empty jets can be made available to clients at a fraction of the normal cost of chartering an aircraft. The routing and timings of empty legs can often be tweaked to accommodate your preference, provided that the schedule does not impact on the original existing Charter flight with which the empty leg corresponds. </p>
                    <p>More than 30% of all private charters result in an empty leg, and consequently a wide and varied number of possibilities are available. If you have the time and flexibility you can take advantage of thousands of options on empty legs through Private Bush Flights at less than half the normal charter rate. </p>
